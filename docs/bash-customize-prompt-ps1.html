<h2>Customizing your terminal</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"[</span><span class="se">\u</span><span class="s2"> @ </span><span class="se">\h</span><span class="s2">] </span><span class="se">\w</span><span class="s2"> &gt; "</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>in the bash profile will output this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">[aamnah @ Serenity] ~/Sandbox/aamnah.com &gt;
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>\u</code> is your username which in my case is <strong>aamnah</strong>;</li>
<li><code>\h</code> is the hostname (the name of your machine) which is <strong>Serenity</strong> </li>
<li><code>\w</code> is the working directory which in my case is <strong>~/Sandbox/aamnah.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can add or remove variables to customize what it shows in the terminal. For example, i don&#39;t want to see the username and hostname, because i already know what they are on my machine.</p>

<p>If i were to ever wonder which user it is i can always use the <code>whoami</code> command to show which user it is. If i were to wonder about the hostname i can easily view that by typing <code>hostname</code>.</p>

<p>So i only show the working path which is the most important. Like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\w</span><span class="s2"> &gt; "</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which displays like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">~/Sandbox/aamnah.com &gt; 
</code></pre></div>
<p>To reload the bash profile without quiting and re-opening the terminal run <code>source ~/.bash_profile</code>, or a simpler <code>exec bash</code> command.</p>
