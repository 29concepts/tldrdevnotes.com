<p>Process data and Ownership data in Linux use UIDs exclusively. </p>

<p>This can create diffculties if a user is deleted while he still owns files in the filesystem. His UID can perhaps be assigned to a different user, and that user will inherit the previous UID owners files.</p>

<p>There is no technical problem with assigning the same numerical UID to different usernames but these users will have equal access to the files owned by that numeric UID. Don&#39;t do it if you don&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>We can find out an account id with </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">id
</code></pre></div>

<p>id will give you the</p>

<ul>
<li>user id <code>id -u username</code></li>
<li>group id <code>id -g username</code></li>
<li>other groups the user is a member of <code>id -G username</code>. similar to <code>groups username</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>root&#39;s UID is always 0</strong>. that&#39;s how you determine if the user is root in bash scripts..</p>
