Quit Chrome and all of it's processes. Open the browser via the Terminal using the following command.

# Mac

    open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security

#Linux

    google-chrome --disable-web-security

Also if you're trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.

    -â€“allow-file-access-from-files

# Windows

For Windows go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and type

    chrome.exe --disable-web-security

OR 

    chromium-browser --disable-web-security
  
It's going to allow us to use any of the apps that don't use device hardware right in your browser.
