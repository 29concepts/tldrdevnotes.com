1. Only plan for 4-5 hours of real work every day
2. Done is better than perfect
3. More work hours doesn't mean more productivity
4. Separate thinking and execution to execute faster and think better
5. Keep the same context everyday. Switching between projects/clients is unproductive
6. If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate!
7. Write down everything that distracts you. Google searches, random thoughts, new ideas, whatever. The point is if you write them down, they'll stop bubbling up when you're in the zone
