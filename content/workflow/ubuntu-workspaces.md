title: Using workspaces like a  pro in Ubuntu

**tl;dr**

With the keyboard shortcuts, i now `ctrl+alt+up/down` to move between workspaces which have full screen apps. And `shift+ctrl+alt+up/down` to move an app between workspaces. `F11` to make an app full screen

---

- <kbd>F11</kbd> - make app full screen
- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>UP/DOWN</kbd> - move app to a Workspace above or below
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>UP/DOWN</kbd> - move to Workspace up or below

Also set the below Gnome Tweaks

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
``` 

- _Tweaks > Workspaces > Dynamic Workspaces_ will create/remove Workspaces on the fly
- _Tweaks > Workspaces > Display Handling > Workspaces span displays_ will move all displays, very helpful when you have a multi-monitor setup

The top thing i missed about macOS after switching to a Thinkpad with Ubuntu was the swipe gestures. I could three-finger swipe left/right to switch between full screen apps. 

On Ubuntu, i tried to do the same thing by setting up gestures, but it wasn't as smooth as i wanted.

Ever since i have figured out the shortcuts and started using them, i have felt more productive
