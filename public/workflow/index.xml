      <description>Right now i use 4 different editors.
 Visual Studio Code Sublime Text 3 Brackets LightPaper  Visual Studio Code  Visual Studio Code is THE BEST editor if you want an IDE. Git, Terminal offered out of the box. This is my go to editor for most projects Preferred editor of JavaScript (React) coders. Has support for things like JSX, Standard style etc. Supports Emmet out of the box Installing (and Disabling) Extensions is really easy and simple Git support is awesome.</description>

      <description>Cask let&amp;rsquo;s you install commonly used software, stuff that you would drag and drop to install, via the Terminal or a script. For example,
brew cask install google-chrome  will install Google Chrome. While Homebrew let&amp;rsquo;s you install command line utilities, Cask let&amp;rsquo;s you install macOS desktop (GUI) software.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer, you can use cask to install your preferred browsers, code editors, tools and such with a simple script.</description>

      <description>See this bash script to install a local AMP setup on macOS
Why not just MAMP? Becaus i was running low on space. MAMP takes about 1.8GB+ on my current MacBook Air with 128GB of base storage.. I am assuming this local setup takes much less space. XAMPP also takes about 2GB+, which is too much when i just want a simple local server with PHP.
You will need to run some commands as the root (super) user.</description>

      <description>First things first, read How to create a Snippet in Sublime Text for some basics.
To create a snippet in Sublime Text you save it with a file extension of .sublime-snippet in the Packages folder (/Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User on a Mac).
Quick Tip: You can use the shortcut Cmd+Shift+G and paste ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User to open the folder.
For every snippet that you want to add, you create a new file.</description>

      <description>Basics  The file name should end in .subime-snippet. It should be saved in (Mac) /Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User See this page for the data folder on other OS. The code must ve wrapped in a &amp;lt;![CDATA[ ]]&amp;gt; tag. You can use $1 to indicate where to place the cursor after inserting the template. For example, for an HTML5 template you can place it between &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; tags like so: &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;$1&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; and this is where the cursor will be after the snippet is inserted.</description>

      <description>It includes the following - Minify JS - Minify CSS - Minify HTML - Optimizie Images - Create responsive screenshots
We&amp;rsquo;ll use pageres to generate screenshots of the website in multiple resolutions. This comes in handy when you need to show that your website is responsive, need to check it looks good in all resolutions or just need a screenshot of the website to include as a preview.
For example, WordPress themes automatically pick up &amp;lsquo;screenshot.</description>

      <guid>/workflow/grunt-task-page-website-speed-optimization-minify-concat/</guid>
      <description>This Grunt task will be able to take care of the following:
 Minifying CSS Minifying JS Minifying HTML Concatentaing multiple JS files Concatenating multiple CSS files Optimizing Images  NOTE: ImageOptim is wayyyy better than imagemin. Imageoptim &amp;lsquo;Saved 3MB out of 24.9MB. 15.4% per file on average (up to 84.7%)&amp;rsquo; where imagemin did &amp;lsquo;Minified 368 images (saved 0 B)&amp;rsquo; for the same files. The only issue is, Image optim works on your mac and opens imageoptim installed on it to compress images.</description>
