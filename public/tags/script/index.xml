      <description>OCMOD and vQmod are both modification systems for Opencart which allow you to change things without overwriting any core files. For Opencart version older than 2.x, vQmod was the king. With version 2.x Opencart launched it&amp;rsquo;s own modification system to replace the need for installing a separate extension.
The state Opencart is in right now, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself dealing with both vqmod and ocmod scripts. I know i do. So i have written this neat bash script which allows me to type ocmod foo to create a file called foo.</description>

      <description>The following bash script will create a main sass stylesheet style.scss and then create additional sass stylesheets for all devices (mobile.scss, ipad.scss, desktop.scss, wide.scss, iphone.scss) in a folder called media-queries.
In the end, we will combine stylesheets for all devices into one by importing them into our main style.scss.
I have divided the code for different devices in their own stylesheets becuase it keeps it is neat and organized and i prefer it that way.</description>
