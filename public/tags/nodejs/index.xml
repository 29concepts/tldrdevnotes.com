      <description>Node has a builtin http module, which allows us to create an HTTP server on a TCP connection The issue with the builtin module is that it requires a lot of code and configuration to setup something basic, and can be difficult and overwhelming You&amp;rsquo;re forced to learn about stuff (like Networking), but it is also error-prone Express is literally just a routing library with middleware It allows you to set up verbs with routes and then run the functions you tell it to run when those routes and verbs are hit by a request  FUN FACT: One of the HTTP status codes is 418: I&#39;m a teapot.</description>
