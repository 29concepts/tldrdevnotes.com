      <description>Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. - Donald Knuth
  Write your code for humans, humans are the ones who&amp;rsquo;ll read, maintain and improve it. Computers only get machine code, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it. Whitespace is amazing when done right Be consistent. Be consistent in your naming, in capitalization, in spacing, in indentation, in code style. Pick a style, and stick to it.</description>

      <description>Recursion A recursive function is a function which calls itself.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how it goes: beginning recursion -&amp;gt; recursive loop of repeating a task -&amp;gt; until we hit our base case.
 a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.</description>

      <description>Higher-order Functions - Any complicated function that was composed by combining simple functions is a higher order function. - Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. - Eloquent JavaScript - A higher-order function is a function that takes other functions as arguments and/or returns a function as it&#39;s result. - Wikipedia  Notes  Functions are values.</description>

      <title>Packages and Dependencies</title>

      <description>They call it package, because many times you would have a collection of libraries that are packaged together, and you download that package rather than each individual library. As for dependency, many times a package will depend on another package, and the dependency manager can help solve that problem.
A dependency manager also takes care of versioning and package updates.
Each programming language has it&amp;rsquo;s own flavor of dependency manager. For instance, for Javascript Node.</description>
