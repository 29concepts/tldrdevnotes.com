      <description>CocoaPods CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. Kinda like what npm is for Node.js and what Composer is for PHP.
tl;dr sudo gem install cocoapods cd project-dir pod init # edit the Podfile pod install # open the .xcworkspace file and get to work  install
sudo gem install cocoapods  pod setup --verbose  create an Xcode project, save it, exit Xcode.
Now open Terminal, cd into the directory of your project, and run</description>

      <description>This talk by Yoav Shwartz on the Realm.io site and this post by Ryan Jones on Medium are the best starting points I have come across.
The official documentation by Apple on CoreBluetooth is in Objective-C, which sucks because Objective-C looks like gibberish to me and i want to write Swift code. You can still read the docs though, they have listed best practices to work with BLE and CoreBluettoth.</description>
