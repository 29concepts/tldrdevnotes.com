There is this notion that i should respect old people just because they are old. I disagree. Respect has to be earned. 

It is easier to respect and love people when you haven't seen them at their worst.

You have not bathed Ammi jaan and changed her diapers. You have not changed her diaper in the washroom of a restaurant on the road to Multan. You have not seen abajan having an angry fit. You have not experienced being on the receiving end of his rude remarks. You have not experienced him making and breaking promises on a daily basis. You have not seen abajan at his worst. You have not seen them fight. You have not seen abajan belitteling ammijaan and being dominiaring. you have not experienced abajan's indifference towards other people's pain or his misery or his old age nonsense or his angry fits or his rude responses. You have also probably not seen your mother and your brother cry at night because of all that. Or your brother getting sick because of exhaustion or your eyes being so swollen you could only half open them. You do not know Aba jan and ammi jan like we do.


Hopefully we'll get back today and these horrible ten days of pure slavery will end.

Hum Mujeb uncle k ghar stay kr rhay thay, aur raat k saray bara bjay jab hum ghar pohanchtay thay packing kr k to hum itnay thakay huay hotay the k 2 bjay tk kisi ko kamrya me neend nahi aati thi.


Umar ko fatigue ki waja se bukhar ho gya. Umar ko. Bukhaar. Exhaustion ki waja se. Meri ankhen swelling ki waja se adhi khul rahi thi. Hath aisay phulay huay the jesay kisi ne stuffing ki ho. Pao pe bhi swelling. Swelling, mujhe, ankhon tak pe. Ammi ko to swelling, constipation, sar dird, thakan sab throughout rha.

I even bathed her and changed her diapers.

Hmara to aba jan ka koi aur hi image tha. In Khanewal we got to see another side of his which was disappointing and sad. 

Aba jan ne zung lagi hui keelain (nails) bhi rakhwai, steel ka lota bhi rakhwaya, kheto ka poison bhi rakhwaya. 

Their notion of 'valuable' is different than ours. What is junk to us, to them it is VERY valuable. Ye dekho kesi achi cheez ha (insert something very old and/or useless here) Menay us zamanay me (insert year here) ---- ki li thi. Ab aisi nahi milti/kitnay ki milay gi..

puranay zamany me wo laal wali plastic ki tokri hoti thi, jo auntian le k phirti thi bazar. Aba jan k ghar wesi aik pari thi. Haal kharab aik taraf se toti hui, dusri taraf se salai ki hui, rang ganda kala hua wa aur aba jan bazid the k me ye le k jau ga, aur aesay hi le k jau ga. Us tokri me aik carpet saaf krnay wala brush tha, aik weird looking ancient contraption jo apparently jota seedhay krnay k liye use hota ha, zung lagi hui keelo (nails) k daba aur isis tarah ka faltu junk. In the end i convinced him to switch the tokri with a box and packed it for him. There is no way i could persuade him to leave that junk, the best i could do was convince him not to tak ethat junk in that tokri.

Hum sub ka khiyal tha  k ammi jaan aisay hi cheezain jama krti rehti hain aur ammi jaan ko shouq ha cheezain rakhnay ka. It is the opposite. Khanewal main ammi jaan mintain krti rhi k saman nikal do, dawa ko de do, falah-e-insaniat ko de do, Allah wastay de do mgr aba jaan hr bekar cheez ko sanbhal k rakh letay they, ye me le k jao ga.

Hum ne aba jan ko cheekhtay huay suna ha aur lartay huay dekha ha. We have witnessed their fights. Aba jan to 5 min me ammi jaan ko sab k samnay zaleel kr k rakh detay the. And not just in front of us, aur bhi kai rishtay dar bethay hotay the.. niggo, meena, meennay ki biwi waghaira. aur abba jaan ammi jaan ki besti krtay rehtay the. tu aisay hi fazool bolti rehti ha, jhak jhak krti rehti ha, tum mut bola kro meray mamlay me, tumhari koi cheez nahi ha, tumhe kuch nahi pta, me jo marzi kru ga, fazul bakay jati ha.. are some samples of direct insults, all of them in one go. Indirectly he tells us tumhari ammi jan ka to dimagh khrab ha, aisay hi baki jati ha.. and he tells us that quite frequently, every chance he gets. He would also pinpoint how she spends so much time in the washroom on a twice daily basis.

Hum (me and umar) to laado me palay bachay hain, ammi abjan ne rol diye.

The situation in Khanewal was pretty bad. It was hot, there were no rains in Khanewal, and teh house was hot and smelly. Us ghar me deemak, seepage, phulay huay darwazay hr kamray me aur na pani tha na bijli. pani hum mang k peetay the, koi ird gird se baraf la ke deta tha, frdige inka tha nahi. khana hum mang k khatay the, aur chai Khaliq bhai ki taraf se aati thi. AC waha pe tha nahi, jo aik split lga hua tha uski bhi gas nikli hui aur uper kapray charay huay. Ghar me enter hotay hi bu ati thi cz seepage aai hui thi sab kamro me. matti itni zyada k hamary kapro k rang badal jatay the. pani aata nahi tha, daily motor chalatay the ja k. motor beech me kharab bhi ho jati thi, to phir hum beth k pani ka intizar krtay the. meaning, you wait if you want to use the washroom. and there was only one functional bathroom, dusray me pani hi nahi ata tha. the functional bathroom had a non-functional door jo band nahi hota tha, so i'd close the store door and the closet door and announce that i'm going to the washroom taka koi na aye.

We used to attribute quite a few things to Abajan, baat ka pakka hona being one of them. 'Ab me ne keh dia'. In Khanewal 'menay keh dia' went out the window.
And of all the dealings he did infornt of us with people, he acted very much like the gullible old man instead of a wise one.

At some point i'll forget all about what happened in Khanewal and go back to loveing them and smiling at them but today i don't feel that overwhelming love. The love has been overshadowed by lots of nonsense and exhaustion and disappointment and anger.
