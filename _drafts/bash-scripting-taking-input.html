<p>There are multiple ways of taking input via the Shell.</p>
<h2>Using the 'read' command to prompt for input</h2>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your name:"
read user_name

echo "Hello $user_name!"
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what the script will look like when we run it.</p>
<pre><code>$ sh nameexample
Enter your name: Sarah
Hello Sarah!
</code></pre>
<h2>Using Command-Line Arguments for Input</h2>
<p>Command line arguments given to a script become variables whose names are numbers. $1 is the first command-line argument, $2 is the second, and so on. $0 is the name by which the script was invoked.</p>
<h2>Defining Variables</h2>
