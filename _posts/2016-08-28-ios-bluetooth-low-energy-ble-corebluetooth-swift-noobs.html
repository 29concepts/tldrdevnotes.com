<p>This <a href="https://realm.io/news/yoav-schwartz-corebluetooth-peripherals/">talk by Yoav Shwartz</a> on the Realm.io site and this <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanjjones10/how-to-set-up-ble-with-swift-2-2-34bb6f209de2">post by Ryan Jones</a> on Medium are the best starting points I have come across.</p>
<p>The official documentation by Apple on CoreBluetooth is in Objective-C, which sucks because Objective-C looks like gibberish to me and i want to write Swift code. You can still read the docs though, they have listed <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/BestPracticesForInteractingWithARemotePeripheralDevice/BestPracticesForInteractingWithARemotePeripheralDevice.html">best practices</a> to work with BLE and CoreBluettoth.</p>
<p>You do need to have an iOS device in order to use CoreBlueooth, it is not supported in the Simulator. It was, originally, but they removed it after a year because BLE got more advanced and it was difficult to remove inconsistencies between Mac and iPhone implementations, or sumthin' like that..</p>
<p>Look at other people's Swift code dealing with CoreBluetooth on Github.</p>
