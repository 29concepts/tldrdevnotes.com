<p><code>sass --help</code> OR <code>sass -h</code> OR <code>sass -?</code><br />
will give you a whole list of commands you can use and how to use them.</p>
<p><code>sass --style compressed main.css</code><br />
will output a compressed version of main.css in the console.</p>
<p><code>sass --style compressed main.css:main.css</code><br />
the file before the : is the input file and the one after is the output file.</p>
<p><code>sass --style expanded main.css:main.css</code><br />
converts to 'expanded' style, which is nested but without the indentation.</p>
<p><code>sass -l main.css:main.css</code><br />
<code>-l</code> flag adds line numbers (as well as file name) corresponding to where the code is in the .sass file and adds it as comments to the .css output.</p>
<pre class="lang:sass decode:true ">@mixin old {
    @warn "Please use new() instead"
}</pre>
<p><code>@warn</code> let's you warn users about the code. For example, if a mixin/code/function is deprecated, you can warn the users about it and tell them to use the new one. @warn is added in the .scss file and is outputted in the console. In other words, it prints an error to Terminal showing a defined message.</p>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>When an error is at the end of a line, it is usually a missed semi colon <code>;</code></li>
</ul>
