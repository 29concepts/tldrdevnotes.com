<p>Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters wrote this 'Zen of Python'. It is considered like a summary manual of python's philosophy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
<strong>Simple is better than complex.</strong><br />
Complex is better than complicated.<br />
<strong>Flat is better than nested.</strong><br />
Sparse is better than dense.<br />
<strong>Readability counts.</strong><br />
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br />
Although practicality beats purity.<br />
Errors should never pass silently.<br />
Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />
Now is better than never.<br />
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br />
<strong>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</strong><br />
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br />

<p>Note:<br />
If you have Python 2.1.2 or later you can read the Philosophy of Python whenever you want by initiating Python and running <code>import this</code>. Just do the following:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true "> $ python
 Python 2.2 (#1, Apr 17 2002, 16:11:12) 
 [GCC 2.95.2 19991024 (release)] on some-os
 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import this</pre>
